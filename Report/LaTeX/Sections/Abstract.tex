An analysis is performed on the muon semi-leptonic decay channel of a pair of W bosons produced in 500 GeV center of mass energy ${e}_{L}^{-}{e}_{R}^{+}$ collisions at the ILC. The invisible decay products are reconstructed using conservation laws and the visible reconstructed data. Angular distributions defining the semileptonic decay are extracted from generator level particles and cuts are applied on the reconstructed particles to obtain the angular dependance of the reconstruction efficiency. The analysis reveals an angular dependence of the efficiency which is not currently modelled in the Electroweak polarisation fit for the ILC.
