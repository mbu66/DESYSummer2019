An analysis was performed on the muon semi-leptonic decay channel of a pair of W bosons produced in 500 GeV center of mass energy ${e}_{L}^{-}{e}_{R}^{+}$ collisions at the ILC. The invisible decay products were reconstructed using conservation laws and the visible reconstructed data. Angular distributions defining the semileptonic decay were extracted from generator level particles and cuts were applied on the reconstructed particles to obtain the angular dependance of the reconstruction efficiency. The analysis reveals an angular dependace of the efficiency which is not currently modelled in the Electroweak polarisation fit for the ILC.
