I would like to thank my supervisor Jakob Beyer for giving me a cool project and always providing instant support whenever I asked for help. Not only this but he provided help to the other summer students in the FLC group without complaint, which went really above and beyond. I'd also like to thank the rest of the FLC group for providing a welcoming environment for us, inviting us on group excursions in and outside of work. Further, Daniel Heuchel and Vladimir Borchanikovn were great office mates and were a pleasure to work alongside.

It was great getting to know the other summer students in the FLC group - Sukee Dharani, Andreas Loeshcke Centeno, Peter Mckeown and Lorenzo Cotrozzi. They are all wonderful people and made the long hours writing reports and presentations a lot more bearable, ordering pizza to the office was a terrific idea.

I'd like to thank all the summer students who organised group events on the weekends, like our excursions to Cuxhaven and L\"ubeck, and made any food for the community, the cultural food picnic on the last Sunday was fantastic. In particular Jana Wittmann, who organised many events and made many cakes, even delivering one at 5 am!

Finally I'd like to thank Olaf Behnke and the organisation team for all their hard work in making this summer programme run smoothly.
