      abstract     = {The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a planned
                      electron-positron collider with a first stage at a
                      center-of-mass energy of 250 GeV. The electron beam will be
                      polarized to $80\%$ and the positron beam to $30\%.$ This
                      allows for very precise measurements of Standard Model (SM)
                      parameters, and of properties of the Higgs boson as well as
                      unique searches for physics beyond the SM. In particular,
                      the ILC will provide unprecedented measurement precision on
                      electroweak observables, aiming for up to 2 orders of
                      magnitude better precision than previously achieved. This
                      will provide a deep insight into the chiral structure of the
                      SM and open an additional portal to physics beyond the SM.In
                      this thesis, a new study at 250 GeV will be presented using
                      a combined analysis of $W$- and $Z$-pair production, as well
                      as single-$W$ production and 2-fermion final state. This
                      analysis will provide a coherent extraction of the total
                      cross sections and the left-right asymmetries of all
                      considered channels, as well as anomalous Triple Gauge
                      Couplings and the luminosity-weighted average polarization,
                      which is used as the absolute scale calibration of the
                      polarization for all physics analyses.This study shows that
                      a relative uncertainty of a few permille for all these
                      measurements is already feasible at the first stage of the
                      ILC and that a polarized positron beam is essential for
                      achieving this level of precision for the total cross
                      section and the left-right asymmetry. Furthermore,
                      systematic uncertainties including their correlations are
                      considered in this analysis and their impact on the
                      measurement precision on the electroweak observables will be
                      presented.The simulation of the ILD detector concept is
                      based on a detailed baseline design which considers many
                      real-life details of the detector, the accelerator and their
                      interface. One of these aspects is the requirement on the
                      vacuum quality in the beam-pipe. In this context,
                      interactions between the electron bunch of the ILC and the
                      residual gas atoms in the interaction region of ILD, their
                      pressure dependency and their impact on the detector was
                      studied with Geant4-based simulations. This was motivated by
                      a redesign of the forward region of ILD, due to two changes
                      in the ILC baseline design which reduced the focal length of
                      the final doublet and introduced an additional beam position
                      monitor. A part of the required space for this was regained
                      by removing an original foreseen vacuum pump at this
                      location. In this thesis, it will be shown that beam-gas
                      collisions constitute a non-negligible, but minor source of
                      background even if the pump is removed.},
