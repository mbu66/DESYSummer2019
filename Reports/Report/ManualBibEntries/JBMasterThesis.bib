      abstract     = {Vector boson scattering (VBS) is considered a
                      well-motivated target in the search for physics beyond the
                      Standard Model (BSM). Setting stringent limits on BSM
                      physics inthe Higgs and electroweak sector requires
                      precision measurements of VBS. This is best done in the
                      clean and controlled environment at high-energy
                      electron-positron colliders.In this work, the sensitivity of
                      the International Linear Collider (ILC) to VBS in hadronic
                      final states is studied at √s = 1 TeV in the International
                      Large Detector (ILD). Datasets from full detector
                      simulations are used for this study.A key aspect of this
                      analysis is the separation of the WW and ZZ final state. In
                      the hadronic final state, this is done primarily through
                      reconstructed boson masses. Themass peaks of the WW and ZZ
                      final states are found to be well separated, but
                      inconsistencies with previous studies are observed. Problems
                      in the final state reconstruction are identified to
                      originate from heavy jet reconstruction as well as jet
                      clustering.Neutrino corrections for heavy quark jets are
                      investigated. A promising approach based on the average
                      kinematics in semi-leptonic decays is identified.The peak
                      separation is tested for two versions of the ILD - a large
                      and a small model - and found to not be visibly
                      influenced.First steps towards a VBS analysis in an EFT
                      framework are taken. No optimization of the cut analysis or
                      application of corrections to heavy jets are done in this
                      step, but are identified as important aspects of future
                      analyses. Sensitive observables are extracted for
                      reconstructed WW and ZZ signal regions. Significances of
                      S/√B = 104 for WW final state events and 40 for ZZ events
                      are observed.Assumptions made in recent theory-level studies
                      which predict a sensitivity between 2 and 4 times better
                      than current LHC analyses are confirmed to be roughly
                      valid.},
